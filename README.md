# California House Price Prediction Dashboard




This Dash application leverages the California House Price dataset, sourced from the 1990 California census. Comprising 20,640 observations and encompassing 10 numerical features, the dataset offers a comprehensive view. Various pages within the application provide insights through descriptive statistics, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data. Another page features an Interactive Prediction section, enabling users to input values into the model. I offer both a linear model and an XGBoost model for analysis. Users have the autonomy to deliberately choose the model that aligns with their preferences.
